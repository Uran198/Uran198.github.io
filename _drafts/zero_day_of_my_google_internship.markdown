TL;DR
=====

Mostly, this will not be about what is it like to have a Google internship or how to get it. There are plenty of these
goods online and you can find it easely. This will be mostly about my experiences one day before the internship, a
little before and after.

Before the zero day
===================

In the beggining of the last summer, a friend of mine suggested refering me to Google. The first thing that I told him
was that I won't be able to pass, but, thanks to him, he insisted. He also helped me with a resume and a preparation.

I worked hard to prepare for the interviews. The ability to solve algorithmic coding questions is required not only for
a job in top tech companies, so I actually started my preparation long time before. Still, I had to make an effort to
polish my skills and to remember all that I might have had forgotten.

After about a month, I knew that I passed the technical interviews. I wanted to work at Google, so I felt the mixture of
exitement and anxiety about upcoming project matching.

I was lucky to get an amazing recruiter. She helped me a lot in all the stages of the process. Although I understand
that it is her job, I still feel very grateful.

I had a lot of interviews during the project matching phase, and the one far from the first was successful and I got an
offer, nearly a month before my desired start date.

I was very happy and cheerfull for a moment and, also, worried about getting a visa, finding a place to stay at, buying
airplane tickets and doing some technical preparations.

Nearly a week before my start date I got a visa, and I already had my tickets. There were still few tasks that I
should have done before leaving (mainly, making it work with my university), but I had no time (or desire) to complete
them.

I've never undertaken such a long journey for so long and so far away before. It was an interesting experience, at the
same time exciting and frightful.

Actual zero day
===============

My journey started at 2:50 on 18th of September 2016. I left the dorm I was living in and got to the airport at 3:30.
The plane should've departed at ~6.35 so I was a bit early. Check-in opened in 1-1.5 hours after my arrival. I decided
to wrap up my bag in plastic, there is a special service at the airport. My luggage started to look like it got pregnant
and I felt a bit stupid.

After checking-in and passing all the security checks I still had some time to spare before departure, so I learned the
plan of a duty-free by heart. I also needed to buy an adapter for US plugs. I found one at 14 euros - too expensive.

Finally, I got on a plane and arrived at Frankfurt.

Frankfurt is a huge airport! To get from one terminal to another I had to ride a small train. There were 2 hours left till my
flight, so I had a walk in a duty free. I found a plug adapter at 14 euros - too expensive.

I got into the huge plane. There were like 8 places in a row and 2-3 buses to take all the passengers to the aircraft.
There were a lot of free places on a plane.

This is how my 12-hour flight started. I really liked, how I was fed, but there was clearly not enough space for my
legs, so I barely got any sleep.

After arrival to the airport, I had to undergo a huge queue before passport control. I went to fetch my luggage, and it
was really easy to find it. It was the only one wrapped. The feeling of being a fool was with me once again.

There was a bus from the airport to where I wanted to go, so I went to the stop. I talked with a guy there, and
figured that bus will not have a change from my 100 dollar bill.

I was thinking what should I do. Is there an ATM somewhere nearby, or some small shop? Meanwhile, the guy at the stop
talked a little with me, and gave me $2 needed for the bus ride! It turned out he was from Litva and speaks Russian. So
the first person I talked to in the US, spoke Russian!

He was a really cool dude. Apart from giving me the money for a ride, he pointed me to the exact bus I needed.

After getting into the bus, now I was thinking that I will just be checking GPS on my phone and get out where I needed.
Unfortunately, my GPS did not want to work in the bus. I asked the driver and he promised to tell me where I should get
off.

The bus driver turned out to be a really cool guy, too. He was very friendly, and joked a bit, but I didn't get all of
it because of the noice, and, well, I did not get a lot of English practise back home.

Afer arrving at my destination, I went to the Starbucks to get some WI-FI and contact a guy I stayed with. I decided to
get a coffee to make my Wi-fi usage more legit. It costed about $2, but the terminal refused to take my card. After
about 3 tries I just got it for free. Probably because of the line that started to form behind me.

At about 17:00 I got to the place, and met a guy I would stay with. Also, a very cool dude! We went to the nearby shop
and finally I bought myself an adapter at $13 - just the right price.

I was quite happy about how my first day in the US went.

After the zero day
==================

On September 19th I alredy had my first day of an internship. Needless to say that I was super exited and happy at that
moment. First few weeks were super tiring and exhausting. I loved it!

Apart from the internship itself, I traveled a bit to the San Francisco and some other places, so it was quite fun, too.

When it all calmed down a little and I got into some kind of routine, I thought that well, I wanted something, and
here I got it, but I felt extremely empty inside nevertheless. I knew that I should be happy. This internship is
something I wanted badly. It is something that a lot of people dream about. And here I was, feeling a bit depressed
having it.

I still had a good time. I visited amazing places, met great people, the project was extremely interesting, and in
general being an intern at Google is extremely fun thing to do. But at the same time, I felt completely confused. I
had no idea what I wanted to do with my life in general. Everything seemed pointless and empty. I understood that
internship will pass, even if I'll get an offer, it is unlikely that it will change anything, and I will be left with
the same confusion.

At the time, I didn't really know what was going on with me, I just felt that something wasn't right. In retrospection,
I think here are some reasons why I might have felt that way.

Firstly, it was difficult for me. I probably wasn't the best possible fit for the job, but I got lucky and polished my
skills of solving algorithm coding questions (coding on a whiteboard, etc.). So, it was difficult, and I understood that
I might be just a waste of someone else's time and money.

Secondly, before the intership, I had a kind of plan, according to which I would work and then try to get into
freelancing and finally possibly create my own small online business of some sort, and this internship wasn't really in
a plan.

Thirdly, I really wanted to get the internship and I got it. I guess after getting something you want, after achieving
your goal, the place inside you, where this goal resided becomes empty. And that is exactly how I felt. I felt that
every single thing was pointless. I knew for a fact that getting what I wanted, didn't bring me fullfillment, didn't
make me happy. So, what is the point of setting and achieving goals, if they bring no joy? I had no goal and I didn't
see a point of having one.

During the internship, I probably did OK. I wasn't happy with my performance, but I learned a lot and met wonderful
people. I had a wonderful host, a great mentor and the team I was interning in was great.

So what did I learn?
====================

I am still quite confused, but I am beggining to think straight and figuring out what should I do. Goals do not look all
that important for fullfilling life, or general well-being, and from my experience don't make one happy, either.

I think that I felt in the best way about myself, when I was working towards something, and not when I achieved it. I
felt that I was doing something meaningful, cause it brought me closer to something that I wanted. But, if right now,
there seem nothing that I want to pursue, nothing seeems worth pursuing, what should I do?

Well, maybe the way to go is to get myself a solid routine. Living each day accordingly to a plan, knowing that all of
it is pointless, but not worring about what to do. The only thing that's left, is to figure out what to include into
such kind of routine.

These are only my thoughts, that may be wrong (and there is a high chance of it). If you have any opinions of your own
or questions feel free to leave them in the comments, or reach out to me directly.
