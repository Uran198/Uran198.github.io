# Here will be html from ipython notebook, for now some notions
 Outline:
  - I've never thought that I'll have fun doing university project. Usually they quite theoretic and have no obious practical
  implications. This one was little different. Although it's hard to come up with practical implications here either,
  but it was about simulation phisicall process, which is at least no in abstract world of math. So, the problem was to
  make a model of pendulum to which non-periodic force is ampied.
  After small research, I figured what needed to be done. In essense just to build differential equation that will
  describe process of moving pendulum and solve it.
# Would be great to have a picture with strenghts.
  I started with writing out all the forces involved.
# Here will be the formulas.
  s - is the arc length.
  Provide from wiki a little modified derivation of equation.
  Provide a link to wiki page for other methods of getting an equation.

  Here we have an differential equation. So solve it, we need to have initial conditions, i. e. initial position of
  pendulum and it's initial speed. It will be the value of theta(0) and theta'(0).
  We will solve this with numerical methods. Maybe there is analitic solution, but I couldn't come up with one.
# Here will be code of the solution, maybe some explanations with it
  Now, we have to test that it works as expected. Let's add a plot to display changes in theta:
# Here adding a plot to display changes of theta
  Now this is better, but we can do better.
  Let's go ahead and try to make an animation of the thing.
# Here is the animation code and explanations.
  Great!
  Now comes the fun part. Basically it's playing with the force.
# Here will look at different behaviours depending on the force.
# Tring t * sin(t), exp(t) * sin(t), exp(t), t, changing angle and constant
# Also, exp(-t) etc. someting that will decreas up to 0, but not less
# Maybe some periodic forces also
# Compensating gravitational force.
# But, not too much. I think max 3-4 examples would suffice
  What I used for this. IPython notebook.
# What I use can go in the begging as well.
